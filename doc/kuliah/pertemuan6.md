Denial Of Service (DOS) is an incident in which a user or organization deprived of resources services they would normally expect to have. In a denial-of-service distributed, large sejumllah compromised system (sometimes called botnet) attack one target
2. How to Prevent DOS / DDOS
How to prevent DOS / DDOS yet because we are at a client server system. But there are ways to lighten up a bit terhidar of DOS and DDOS ie, Increase the capacity of service if an attacker does not raise capacity demand, IP Blocking the attacker in the firewall, enter all the attacker's IP to the firewall and Making Honey Pot (making programs and in-coding)
Cover
