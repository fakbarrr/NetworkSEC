Explanation

How to immobilize may vary and consequently can vary. The system under attack may be "stunned" (hangs, crashes), not functioning or down performance (because of high CPU load).

This attack is different from data theft crimes or crimes monitor inforamasi passing. In a DoS attack nothing was stolen, but this can lead to financial loss. For example, if the system is under attack is the server that handles the transaction "commerce", then when the server is not working, the transaction can not take place.

Or a credit card merchant server is under attack, so it can not accept payment by credit card.
