The reporting process is done Radius server can be in the form of time (seconds, minutes, hours, etc.) as well as in the form of large data transfers (Byte, KByte, MByte) (Anonymous-B, 2006). Radius server software used in this study is FreeRADIUS that is modular and has many features. FreeRADIUS server is a software based on open source and licensed under the GPL.
Radius server is typically implemented on a Linux OS or Windows NT, Free radius of one of the popular Linux OS
